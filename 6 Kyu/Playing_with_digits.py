# Some numbers have funny properties. For example:
# 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1
# 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
# 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
# Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p
# we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.
# In other words:
# Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k
# If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.
# Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.

# dig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
# dig_pow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k
# dig_pow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
# dig_pow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

def dig_pow(n, p):
    total = 0
    for num in str(n):  #itertating through the number
        total += int(num)**p # multiplying to the power p and adding that number to the total
        p += 1 #increase the power 1
    return total/n if total % n == 0 else -1 # if the total divided by the orginal number is a whole number, that is returned else -1
